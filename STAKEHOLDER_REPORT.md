- **Payments Received:** `💰 Payment received - €1,250 for Order #12345`
- **Invoice Generated:** `🧾 Invoice #INV-001 sent to ACME Corp`
- **Shipment Dispatched:** `🚚 Order #12345 shipped via DHL`

**Customer Service:**
- **Support Tickets:** `🎫 New ticket from John Doe - "Product question"`
- **Returns Requested:** `📦 Return request for Order #12345`
- **Customer Updates:** `👤 Customer ACME Corp updated contact info`

**Inventory & Operations:**
- **Low Stock Alerts:** `⚠️ Product ABC123 below minimum stock`
- **Purchase Orders:** `📋 New PO #PO-001 - €5,000 to Supplier XYZ`
- **Product Updates:** `📦 Product catalog updated - 15 new items`

**Financial Monitoring:**
- **Large Orders:** `💎 High-value order - €10,000+ from Premium Client`
- **Overdue Payments:** `⏰ Payment overdue - Invoice #INV-001`
- **Budget Alerts:** `📊 Monthly sales target 80% achieved`

**How to Add New Events:**
1. **In Xentral:** Go to Webhooks → Select any event → Use our webhook URL
2. **Automatic Processing:** Our system automatically handles the new event type
3. **Instant Notifications:** Slack receives formatted notifications immediately

**No Additional Development Required** - The same infrastructure handles all event types!

### 🏢 Production Deployment
- **Ready for Production:** Current system works with sandbox environment
- **Easy Migration:** Simple environment variable changes for production
